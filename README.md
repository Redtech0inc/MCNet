## how to set up

first i would make a DNS server this is easy 
just install <br>

### setup DNS server

`dnsServer.lua` and <br>
`initDns.lua` ona computer <br>
now execute `initDns.lua` and the rest is done by the system <br>

### setup mcNet-client
so first i would advise you to make a folder on the machine where you are going to install the client on so that the files are in one place tho you don't have to do that<br>
for example `internet` as the folder name <br>
now put the `mcNet-client.lua` file in that and execute it once<br>
it is going to give you an error but thats normal now enter the newly created libs folder (my example `internet/libs`)
and drop the `logo.nfp` and the `openUILib.lua` file in there
then go back and execute `mcNet-cleint.lua` again now it should work!
